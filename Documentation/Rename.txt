If you are first installing this on a machine that does 
not have the Docker DB Installed, make sure you remember to 
grab the .env files off the server they are kept and then
run the commands to get it running.

This application depends on a Postgres DB and it itself is built into 
a docker container.

I built this application to expose myself to the Clean Architecture design pattern.
With it we also include containerization and a CI/CD pipeline as well as 
working as much as I can to maintain the documentaion.
